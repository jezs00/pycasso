<p>Local astrology enthusiast Crystal Jones has expressed concern about the new pope after reading that he is a Leo.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known a lot of Leos,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they can&#8217;t be trusted.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is nothing inherently wrong with being a Leo, but I&#8217;ve had enough experiences with them that if I was the Catholic Church, I would keep my eye out on him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pope Leo XIV was disappointed to hear that Crystal thinks he is incompatible and has asked her to check his moon rising in the hopes that it might change things.</p>

<p>The Vatican has secured a rare exemption to Donald Trump&#8217;s sweeping tariffs after electing a made in USA Pope.</p>



<p>&#8220;This new Pope is perfect,&#8221; said a representative for the church, &#8220;being an American he can protect us from the tariffs and any potential invasions.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Plus he is very qualified, his record shows he cares about God and he has already helped cover up sexual abuse in the church. That&#8217;s both the qualities we look for in a leader.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leaders in the Vatican have urged Pope Leo XIV to delete old tweets criticising Vice President JD Vance, out of fears that he might die in similar circumstances to Pope Francis.</p>



<p>In response to the appointment, Trump has declared the Vatican to be the 51st state.</p>

<p>As the conclave vote has been called for Robert Prevost to be the next pope, Australian senator James McGrath has urged the Vatican to calm down and wait for pre-polls.</p>



<p>This comes as the ABC panelist is still waiting to accept the result of last week&#8217;s Australian election.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s far too early to judge&#8221;, he said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t want to jump to any conclusions or have any unnecessary conversations.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reports suggest the LNP are holding out hope for the first ever dead pope to be elected, throwing their support behind George Pell.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has appeared triumphant following today&#8217;s conclave vote, being named the new Pope.</p>



<p>This comes after Donald Trump announced that he wanted to be the Pope, causing Albanese to win in a landslide as voters feared the idea of a Pope Trump.</p>



<p>The proud catholic Albanese gave an impassioned speech to his new following that included reading a Bible Verse and the scripture on his Medicare card.</p>



<p>Albanese teared up at one point telling a story about how growing up his mum never got to have a Popemobile.</p>

<p>As the global catholic communion mourns the death of Pope Francis and prepares for the election of their new religious leader, a local Sydney man, Sam, 27, is hyping himself up for the Roman Catholic Church’s conclave for entirely different reasons. </p>



<p>Sam, a Letterboxd addict and self-proclaimed papal election expert, developed his passion after a New Years Eve screening of the Academy Award winning film <em>Conclave</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is what I&#8217;ve been training for,&#8221; said Sam, before taking a deep rip of a vape pen.</p>



<p>“From the moment Cardinal Tedesco walked on screen, I knew I had found my new personality. I mean who wouldn’t want to be dripped out and have a solid grasp on their life goals and values.&#8221;</p>



<p>While Sam has become heavily invested in following Cardinal Robert Sarah’s chances at “snatching the white smoke”, some have concerns about his new obsession. </p>



<p>Lilly, Sam’s girlfriend, told <em>The Chaser </em>that “it’s the Olympics all over again.”</p>



<p>“It’s like men can’t have a casual interest these days, they’ll keep researching until they are squatting in the shower at 3am reading about the election of Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto in 1903”</p>



<p>While Sam is hoping the conclave drags out like the 1268–71 papal election, his nearest and dearest are hoping it wraps up quickly so he can get back to writing Muppet puns on Letterboxd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the comical results of the weekend&#8217;s election, as well as the untimely passing of the Prime Minister of Catholicism, meetings have begun to elect new leaders.<br><br>During this time of change, questions are being raised within both the Liberals and the Vatican as to how they can stay relevant, with some cardinals even suggesting the new Pope download &#8216;Vine&#8217; to appeal to a younger generation of Catholics.</p>



<p>Experts say that the main difference between electing a new Pope and a leader of the Liberal Party, is that the views of those over 80 are banned from the conclave but are prioritised in the Liberal Party caucus. </p>



<p>We will know who the new leader of the LNP is when white smoke appears from the Prayer Room.</p>

<p>After consistent daily texts, I fear I have been ghosted by H.Fong of the Trumpet of Patriots.</p>



<p>The moment he didn&#8217;t need something from me, he threw me aside. Typical man.</p>



<p>He never asked me how I was doing, or if I needed anything from him, but honestly I liked the attention.</p>



<p>He was coming on hard, but now he has left me feeling used. That what we had wasn&#8217;t real.</p>



<p>He just saw me as a means to an end, as if our connection was purely transactional. It&#8217;s dehumanising. It&#8217;s toxic.</p>



<p>I expect him to send a &#8220;U Up&#8221; in the next month or so, but I will have moved on. I deserve better.</p>

<p>While Peter Dutton is left wishing he had one more Horcrux, Voldemort has released a statement distancing himself from the former Liberal Party leader.</p>



<p>This comes as the dark lord who dedicated his life to hurting others in a relentless pursuit of power lost the Australian election.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hate being associated with him,&#8221; said Voldemort, &#8220;I know my life&#8217;s work was defeated by a child, but the loss that he just suffered was truly embarrassing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want everyone to stop thinking of me when you think of him, it is really hurtful. I have feelings too you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Voldemort has reportedly gone off to do some soul searching to figure out who he is at his core.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already lost my standing as the main villain of the Harry Potter series to JK Rowling, and now I&#8217;m no longer the most hated man who looks like you air-fried Ralph Fiennes for an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite the election campaign being officially over, Peter Dutton has made yet another appearance at a petrol station, this time to apply for a job.</p>



<p>This comes as the former Opposition Leader found himself suddenly unemployed when the nation&#8217;s voters collectively told him to fuck off.</p>



<p>Dutton&#8217;s resume was extensive with references to his time as a fuckwit cop, his time as a fuckwit politician and his unofficial role working as a fuckwit for Gina Rinehart.</p>



<p>Working at a servo would be quite a change for Dutton, as it would be his first job where he isn&#8217;t allowed to abuse minorities groups.</p>



<p>Dutton said that the trip to the servo was one of the hardest things he has ever done, as none of his billionaire &#8216;friends&#8217; are picking up his calls so he had to travel there in his own car instead of taking a private jet.</p>

<p>A disheveled but newly reelected Anthony Albanese has awoken from his election bliss to a personal tragedy. The Labor leader was heard asking Bar Italia patrons this morning if they had seen his medicare card. </p>



<p>The card, which was last seen on stage at Canterbury-Hurlstone RSL club, is understood to be the Prime Minister’s prized possession.</p>



<p>“It started getting passed around in the celebrations last night” said one Labor staffer exclusively to <em>The Chaser,</em> “everyone wanted to hold the card of the hour.” </p>



<p>When asked if someone could have sequestered the card during the chaos for cutting white substances in the club’s bathrooms, the staffer declined to comment.</p>



<p>“I’m not sure why he’s still using his own card,” said one RSL bartender, “You’d think he’d have had a prop made up by this point”</p>



<p>When asked by a Bar Italia patron what the card looked like, Albanese was heard shouting “this card is not Labor red, or Liberal blue, it is green and gold! It is a declaration of our national values, in our national colours”</p>



<p>The Australian Federal Police have announced that they have mounted a full blown investigation and will be utilising the full force of anti-terrorism laws to detain whoever is responsible. Albanese has also promised to double check his suit pockets when he gets back to Kirribilli.</p>
